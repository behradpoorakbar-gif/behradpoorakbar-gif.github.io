<h1>Welcome to Alpaca Adventures</h1>
<p>Alpacas live in the mountains of Peru and are known for their soft wool and gentle
personalities. They travel in groups called herds.</p>
</div> <!--added two extra divs to end the specified content above. without the div, the code would be incomplete since it would be unclear which section was given the id "content" and "home".-->
<div id="wool" class="section dark"> <!--No quotations around the given class "section dark" and "wool". All class selectors must be quoted so that the name can be identified in the css file. Since it was not quoted, the selector could not be found in the html file and changes from the css could not be made.-->
<h2>Wonderful Wool</h2> <!--added a "/" to the h2 ending. This allows the text inside the h2 code block to be marked as a heading and end at the "</h2>". Since there was no "/", the heading did not end at the second <h2> and took up the whole rest of the code.-->
Alpaca wool is light, warm, and water-resistant. It's sheared every year to make cozy
clothing.
<div class="wool-box">
<p>This box demonstrates <strong>absolute positioning</strong>.</p>
<div class="wool-detail">
<p>I'm a smaller box positioned inside the larger one!</p> <!--The first <p> tag is a block element and needs to be end with another </P> tag on the same line. The <p> tag was placed too far and not on the same block as the ending </p> tag, which also caused it to include the div class specification which we do not want in the paragraph.-->

<h2>The Herd Life</h2>
<p>Alpacas are social animals and hum to each other to communicate. They also have a
leader that helps keep order in the group.</p>
</div>
<div id="fun" class="section dark">
<h2>Fun Facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Alpacas can live up to 20 years.</li> <!--Added a closing </li> block. This allows for only the "Alpacas can live up to 20 years." to be apart of one list line and not connected to the rest of the code.-->
<li>They rarely spit at people ‚Äî only other alpacas!</li>
<li>Each alpaca has a unique ‚Äúhum‚Äù sound.</li>
