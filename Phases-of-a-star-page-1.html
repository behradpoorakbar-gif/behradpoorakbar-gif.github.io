    <h1><strong>Phases of a Star</strong></h1>
    <p1>In order for a black whole to be created, a large star must be present for the cyclen to start.</p1>
    <h2>Referee to the following phases:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Stellar Nebula</li>
      <li>large Star</li>
      <li>Red supergiant</li>
      <li>supernova</li>
      <li>nutron star, or if large enough a <strong><em>black whole</em></stronger></li>
    </ol>

      <p2>If the star is large enough, it will slowly die out until it loses its light. Once the star connot perform nuclear fusion to generate  electricty, the star will have grown so large to  point which the star cannot support its own mass. The star will collapse in one massive explosion, blasting a wave of pasma into space. The rest of the star will collapse into a into its stellar point at the center of the now dead star and slowly expand into a black whole. </p2>
