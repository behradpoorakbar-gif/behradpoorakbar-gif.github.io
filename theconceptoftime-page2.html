      <h1.1><p1>The singularity of a black whole is said to be infintly dense. This is because time would be moving so slow that for anyone viewing the black wholes <em>event horizon</em>, it would be as if the object is frozen in time.</p1></h1.1>

    <p2> If you ever get past the event horizon, it would be impossible to escape. Space time would have taken the shape of the black wholes mass so it would appear for someone inside the horizen that they are unaffected, however, they will be slowly be getting sucked closer to the event horizon.</p2>
  <p3>It would take an extraordinarlly long time to reach the singularity, but <small>slowly</small> you will be moving faster than the speed of light. You will approach a point in time where the human body will be hit with such gravitational force caused by the singularities mass that your body will be stretched appart with no chance of survival.
